# 02B - API Development

In this step you will be developing the API you wrote an OpenAPI specification for in the previous step.

# Parts

- `flask` is a Python web framework [[docs](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)]
- `connexion` is a Python framework for applying OpenAPI specification on your API [[docs](https://github.com/zalando/connexion)]
- `boto3`

# Challenge

Implement your API from the previous step using the starter code and your OpenAPI Specification. 

## About the Starter Code

If you run the API via `python app.py` you will be able to hit the documentation page for your API at `localhost:5000/ui/` that is autogenerated from your OpenAPI specification.

You will also see that `localhost:5000/users/me` will also be handled by `get_profile()`. Connexion will use your endpoint's `operationId` to automatically associate your handler code with the endpoint (`app.get_profile` with `GET /users/me` in the example) so you may need to bo back and update the `operationId`s.
